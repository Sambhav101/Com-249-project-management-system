 # Functioning part of the application
 
 You can login as both manager or employee. When logging as manager, it asks for 'Username' and 'Password'. 
      Username: admin
      Password: admin
      
 When logging as employee, it will ask for username and password. IF you are a new user, you can register by following the 'register' link. IF you are returning or registered user, you can input your username and password, and voila! it does nothing. There is still a lot to work on coding to display employee account interface.
